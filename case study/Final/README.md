#### ðŸ“Š Functional Diagrams Overview
Functional diagrams help developers understand what each function doesâ€”specifically, what inputs (parameters) it expects, what it returns, and which other functions or modules it depends on. This clear documentation of behavior and responsibilities minimizes the need for repetitive communication and speeds up collaboration across the team.

#### ðŸ”„ Notation Guide
- Each **rectangle** represents a function and is divided into three sections:
    - **Top:** Function name
    - **Middle:** Parameters (inputs)
    - **Bottom:** Return value
        
- If a rectangle is connected to an **ellipse**, it indicates a dependencyâ€”meaning the function relies on that external file, hook, or module.
